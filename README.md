stereo_animator_blender2.49b
============================

This iterates through all cameras in a scene, replaces each camera with a stereo camera rig and renders the left/right stereoscopic pair to disk. Developed for Blender 2.49b. Not sure if it is necessary for Blender 2.5+, but the code is here for reference.
